**Question:** In the late 18th century, somewhere in an elementary school in Germany, a teacher gave his students the task of adding all the numbers from 1 to 100. He expected to have some rest, but within 10 seconds the young mathematician [Carl Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss) gave the correct answer. How did he do that?
