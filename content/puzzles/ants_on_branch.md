**Question:** In the middle of the forest lies a branch with a length of 1 meter, directed East-West. On the branch are randomly positioned 25 ants, each facing East or West. Ants walk 1cm per second. When two ants meet each other, both ants turn around and start walking in the other direction. How long should you wait, to be certain that ant #13 is off the branch?
