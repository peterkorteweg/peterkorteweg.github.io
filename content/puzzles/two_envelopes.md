**Question:** A quizmaster shows you two envelopes. He tells you that each envelope contains a sum of money, and the amount in one of the envelopes is twice the amount of the other envelope. You choose an envelope, and when you open it you see it contains €1000, in €100 notes. The quizmaster says that if you give him a €100 note, you may switch envelopes. Do you choose to switch?
