**Question:** A mountain hiker leaves early in the morning from her hotel in the valley. She climbs all day and reaches a mountain lodge at the foot of the summit in the evening, and stays there for the night. The next day she continues to climb, reaches the summit and descends back to the hotel where she arrives in the evening. Is it possible that the hiker was at the same altitude at the same time on both the first and second day?
