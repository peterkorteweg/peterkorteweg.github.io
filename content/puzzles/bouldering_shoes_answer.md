**Question:** You go bouldering for the first time. At the bouldering hall is a sign that says: "Bouldering shoes: €5 to rent and €80 to purchase."

You have no idea how often you will go bouldering. When should you switch from renting shoes to purchasing shoes to minimize the maximum regret?

*Note: you may ignore shoe-depreciation and opportunity costs.*

[**Answer**](/puzzles/bouldering_shoes/): Maximum regret is determined by the maximum amount you paid versus the minimum amount you could have paid. [Maximum regret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regret_(decision_theory)) is often considered as price difference or price ratio. E.g. if you buy shoes the first time, and never go again your regret is €80/€5 = 16x or €80-€5=€75. If you switch from renting to buy on your 16th visit the maximum regret is at most 2x ($\frac{80+15*5}{16*5}$), and €75 ($15*5$).
