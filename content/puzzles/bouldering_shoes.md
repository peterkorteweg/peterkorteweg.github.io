**Question:** You go bouldering for the first time. At the bouldering hall is a sign that says: "Bouldering shoes: €5 to rent and €80 to purchase."

You have no idea how often you will go bouldering. When should you switch from renting shoes to purchasing shoes to minimize the maximum regret?

*Note: you may ignore shoe-depreciation and opportunity costs.*
