**Question:** An airplane with 100 seats is fully booked. Passengers enter the airplane one at a time. The first passenger cannot find their ticket, and chooses a random seat. Each next passenger sits on their own seat, or in case their seat is taken, chooses an available seat at random. What is the probability that the last passenger finds their own seat available?
