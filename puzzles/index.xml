      <description>Question: You would like to choose between two holiday destinations by flipping a coin. However, the only coin you have is not a perfect coin. How can you still use this coin to make a fair choice? How many coin flips does your solution require on average?&#xA;Answer: A single coin flip results in heads (H) or tails (T) with unknown probability. But for two consecutive coin flips the probability of HT equals the probability of TH.</description>
